            <div class="caption">The Ocean (a.k.a. The Ocean Collective) is a progressive metal band started in 2000 by German guitarist Robin Staps. The band's first stable line-up was formed by 2009 during recording sessions for Heliocentric and Anthropocentric.</div>

            <div class="row">
                    <p>The Ocean was founded in 2000 by guitarist and songwriter Robin
                        Staps. During the following two years, about 40 musicians joined
                        and left the band until a stable line-up was established. July 
                        2002 saw The Ocean play their first concert at Berlin's now defunct
                        semi-legal Eimer Club. Shortly after, the band released their
                            eponymous debut album featuring Islands/Tides, a 30-minute-long 
                            song that also constituted the substance of their early live shows.
